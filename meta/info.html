    <h1>Pro Micro Template</h1>
    
    <p>
    This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640">Pro Micro</a> form factor. It includes a PCB edge matching the outline of the Pro Micro PCB with connectors placed correctly. It also includes USB-C and optional Stemma QT/Qwiic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: due to the fact that the official 3D library does not include "long" or "stacking" female headers, the default Connector_PinSocket_2.54mm models were used.
